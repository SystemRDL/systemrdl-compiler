# Examples from Accellera
This folder contains a copy of the examples provided by Accellera as [part of the SystemRDL 1.0 spec](https://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemrdl).

Some of the examples use RDL 1.0 constructs that are no longer valid SystemRDL.
Other examples include outright invalid RDL. These have been modified as needed.

* `generic_example.rdl:34`: Reset signal is ambiguous whether it is active high or active low.
  RDL spec does not assume a default behavior in this case, so the example is modified.
* `generic_example.rdl:48`: Property `hwmask` is assigned a boolean which was valid RDL 1.0, but no longer allowed in RDL 2.0 (See Annex C.8). Property assignment removed.
* `generic_example.rdl:64`: Property `resetsignal` is erroneously assigned to a `reg` component when it is only valid for `field` components. Example updated to reference field.
* `interrupt.rdl:376`: Typo. Missing "->next" reference in assignment.
* Many examples in "Leon2" use autogenerated addrmap type names. Renamed for clarity.
* `Leon2/rgu.rdl:163`: Register does not contain fields. Removed.
* `sata_constants.rdl`: Not included from example file.
