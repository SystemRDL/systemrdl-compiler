## Report bugs using the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/SystemRDL/systemrdl-compiler/issues)

## Contribute code using a pull request
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your feature/bugfix branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Submit the pull request!
